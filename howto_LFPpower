%LFPs

%import your LFP by changing working directory to folder with file

>> [timestamps, LFP] = getRawCSCData('LFP17.ncs', 1, 100000000);
%index of start and index of end index.
% since we dont know how many indices are in the file just put a bbig number for the second

%your LFP file is now saved as LFP

%we are now going to bandpass filter your LFP to bbetween 4-10hz. Your sample is 32hz
%I coded this as a FIR filter with a blackman window, with order 300.

>> LFPfilt = theta410(LFP);

%you'll notice yourr filtered LFP is slightly shorter than unfiltered-- this is because it needs to be cropped because the filter window cant slide to the very edges

% power is just your filtered LFP sqaured

>> LFPpower = (LFPfilt).^2; %make sure you put the period there or else it'll do matrix algebra

%if you want to plot it you can just do

>> plot(length(LFPpower)./32000, LFPpower);  %here your x axis will be seconds starting at ~0s based just on the indices of LFPpower
